Developing a **timeslot booking system** for a hair salon involves managing concurrent access to limited resources (i.e., available timeslots) to ensure a smooth and conflict-free booking experience for your clients. Your specific requirements include:

1. **Preventing Double-Booking:** When Client A selects a timeslot and begins the booking process, that slot should be hidden or marked as unavailable to other clients (e.g., Client B) until Client A completes the booking, cancels it, or the reservation expires after 3 minutes.

2. **Reservation Timeout:** Implementing a 3-minute window during which the selected timeslot is held for the initiating client before reverting to available status if not confirmed.

To achieve this, you can implement a **Pessimistic Locking** strategy with a reservation timeout mechanism. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to develop this functionality, including architecture considerations, implementation details, and best practices.

---

## **1. Architectural Overview**

### **1.1. Components Involved**

1. **Frontend (Client-Side):**
   - User Interface (UI) for selecting and booking timeslots.
   - Communicates with the backend via APIs.
   - Displays real-time availability of timeslots.

2. **Backend (Server-Side):**
   - Handles API requests for reserving and booking timeslots.
   - Manages the state of each timeslot (available, reserved, booked).
   - Implements the reservation timeout logic.

3. **Database:**
   - Stores information about timeslots, their statuses, and reservations.

4. **Background Worker (Optional but Recommended):**
   - Periodically checks for expired reservations and releases them.

### **1.2. Workflow Diagram**

1. **Client A** selects a timeslot and initiates a reservation.
2. **Backend** marks the timeslot as "reserved" for Client A with a timestamp.
3. **Client B** attempts to view available timeslots and does not see the reserved slot.
4. **Client A** either completes the booking within 3 minutes or the reservation expires.
5. If **Client A** completes the booking, the slot is marked as "booked"; otherwise, it reverts to "available."

---

## **2. Implementation Details**

### **2.1. Database Schema Design**

Design your database to effectively manage the states of timeslots. Here's an example schema using a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL):

**Tables:**

1. **`timeslots`**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `start_time` (Datetime)
   - `end_time` (Datetime)
   - `status` (ENUM: 'available', 'reserved', 'booked')
   - `reserved_by` (Foreign Key to `users.id`, nullable)
   - `reserved_at` (Datetime, nullable)
   - `booked_by` (Foreign Key to `users.id`, nullable)
   - `booked_at` (Datetime, nullable)

2. **`users`**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `name`
   - `email`
   - ... (other user-related fields)

**Indexes:**

- Index on `status` for quick retrieval of available slots.
- Index on `reserved_at` for efficient querying of expired reservations.

### **2.2. API Endpoints**

1. **Get Available Timeslots**
   - **Endpoint:** `GET /api/timeslots`
   - **Description:** Retrieves all available timeslots, excluding those that are reserved or booked.

2. **Reserve a Timeslot**
   - **Endpoint:** `POST /api/timeslots/{id}/reserve`
   - **Description:** Reserves a specific timeslot for the user.
   - **Request Body:**
     ```json
     {
       "user_id": "user123"
     }
     ```
   - **Response:**
     - **Success:** 200 OK with reservation details.
     - **Failure:** 409 Conflict if the slot is already reserved or booked.

3. **Confirm Booking**
   - **Endpoint:** `POST /api/timeslots/{id}/book`
   - **Description:** Confirms the reservation and marks the slot as booked.
   - **Request Body:**
     ```json
     {
       "user_id": "user123",
       "payment_details": { ... } // Optional, depending on your system
     }
     ```
   - **Response:**
     - **Success:** 200 OK with booking confirmation.
     - **Failure:** 400 Bad Request if reservation doesn't exist or has expired.

4. **Cancel Reservation**
   - **Endpoint:** `POST /api/timeslots/{id}/cancel`
   - **Description:** Cancels the reservation, making the slot available again.
   - **Request Body:**
     ```json
     {
       "user_id": "user123"
     }
     ```
   - **Response:**
     - **Success:** 200 OK with cancellation confirmation.
     - **Failure:** 400 Bad Request if reservation doesn't exist or is already booked.

### **2.3. Backend Logic**

#### **2.3.1. Reserving a Timeslot**

1. **Receive Reservation Request:**
   - Validate the user’s identity and the timeslot ID.

2. **Check Availability:**
   - Query the `timeslots` table to ensure the slot is `available`.

3. **Reserve the Slot:**
   - **Atomic Operation:** Use a database transaction to prevent race conditions.
   - Update the `status` to `reserved`.
   - Set `reserved_by` to the current user's ID.
   - Set `reserved_at` to the current timestamp.

4. **Respond to Client:**
   - If successful, return reservation details.
   - If the slot is already `reserved` or `booked`, return a `409 Conflict` error.

**Example (Using SQL):**
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Check if the slot is available
SELECT status FROM timeslots WHERE id = :id FOR UPDATE;

-- If available, reserve it
UPDATE timeslots
SET status = 'reserved',
    reserved_by = :user_id,
    reserved_at = NOW()
WHERE id = :id AND status = 'available';

-- Check if update was successful
IF ROW_COUNT() = 1 THEN
    COMMIT;
    RETURN SUCCESS;
ELSE
    ROLLBACK;
    RETURN CONFLICT;
END IF;
```

#### **2.3.2. Confirming a Booking**

1. **Receive Booking Confirmation:**
   - Validate the user’s identity and the timeslot ID.

2. **Verify Reservation:**
   - Ensure the slot is `reserved` by the same user and the reservation hasn't expired (i.e., `reserved_at` is within the last 3 minutes).

3. **Book the Slot:**
   - Update the `status` to `booked`.
   - Set `booked_by` to the user’s ID.
   - Set `booked_at` to the current timestamp.
   - Clear `reserved_by` and `reserved_at`.

4. **Respond to Client:**
   - If successful, return booking confirmation.
   - If the reservation doesn't exist or has expired, return a `400 Bad Request` error.

**Example (Using SQL):**
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Verify reservation
SELECT reserved_by, reserved_at FROM timeslots WHERE id = :id FOR UPDATE;

IF reserved_by = :user_id AND reserved_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '3 minutes' THEN
    -- Book the slot
    UPDATE timeslots
    SET status = 'booked',
        booked_by = :user_id,
        booked_at = NOW(),
        reserved_by = NULL,
        reserved_at = NULL
    WHERE id = :id;
    COMMIT;
    RETURN SUCCESS;
ELSE
    ROLLBACK;
    RETURN BAD_REQUEST;
END IF;
```

#### **2.3.3. Cancelling a Reservation**

1. **Receive Cancellation Request:**
   - Validate the user’s identity and the timeslot ID.

2. **Verify Reservation:**
   - Ensure the slot is `reserved` by the same user.

3. **Release the Slot:**
   - Update the `status` back to `available`.
   - Clear `reserved_by` and `reserved_at`.

4. **Respond to Client:**
   - If successful, confirm cancellation.
   - If the reservation doesn't exist or is already booked, return a `400 Bad Request` error.

**Example (Using SQL):**
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Verify reservation
SELECT reserved_by FROM timeslots WHERE id = :id FOR UPDATE;

IF reserved_by = :user_id THEN
    -- Release the slot
    UPDATE timeslots
    SET status = 'available',
        reserved_by = NULL,
        reserved_at = NULL
    WHERE id = :id;
    COMMIT;
    RETURN SUCCESS;
ELSE
    ROLLBACK;
    RETURN BAD_REQUEST;
END IF;
```

#### **2.3.4. Handling Reservation Expiry**

**Option 1: Background Worker (Recommended)**
- **Functionality:**
  - Periodically (e.g., every minute) scans the `timeslots` table for `reserved` slots where `reserved_at` is older than 3 minutes.
  - Releases such reservations by setting `status` back to `available` and clearing `reserved_by` and `reserved_at`.

- **Implementation:**
  - Use a scheduled task (e.g., cron job) or a background worker process.
  - Example using Python with Celery:
    ```python
    from celery import Celery
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    import sqlalchemy

    app = Celery('tasks', broker='redis://localhost:6379/0')

    @app.task
    def release_expired_reservations():
        session = sqlalchemy.create_session()
        expiry_time = datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(minutes=3)
        expired_slots = session.query(Timeslot).filter(
            Timeslot.status == 'reserved',
            Timeslot.reserved_at < expiry_time
        ).all()
        for slot in expired_slots:
            slot.status = 'available'
            slot.reserved_by = None
            slot.reserved_at = None
        session.commit()
    ```

**Option 2: On-Demand Check**
- **Functionality:**
  - Each time a client requests available timeslots, check for and release any expired reservations before returning the data.

- **Pros:**
  - Simpler to implement initially.

- **Cons:**
  - May not scale well; reservations could remain expired longer if no requests are made.
  - Potentially higher latency for the client during data retrieval.

### **2.4. Frontend Considerations**

1. **User Interface:**
   - **Display Available Timeslots:** Fetch from `GET /api/timeslots` and display only available slots.
   - **Disable or Hide Reserved/Booked Slots:** Ensure that reserved slots are not visible or are clearly marked as unavailable.

2. **Initiating a Reservation:**
   - When a user selects a timeslot, immediately send a `POST /api/timeslots/{id}/reserve` request.
   - **Optimistic UI Update:** Temporarily disable the selected slot in the UI to reflect the reservation initiation.

3. **Handling Responses:**
   - **Success:** Allow the user to proceed with booking.
   - **Conflict:** Notify the user that the slot is no longer available and refresh the available slots.

4. **Countdown Timer:**
   - Implement a 3-minute countdown timer for the user to complete the booking.
   - Display a visual indicator (e.g., a timer or progress bar) to inform the user of the remaining time.

5. **Automatic Release on Timeout:**
   - If the user does not complete the booking within 3 minutes, automatically release the reservation and update the UI to reflect the slot's availability.

6. **Real-Time Updates (Optional but Enhances UX):**
   - **WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE):** Implement real-time communication to update clients about changes in timeslot availability.
   - **Polling:** Alternatively, use periodic polling (e.g., every 30 seconds) to refresh available timeslots.

**Example Frontend Workflow (Using JavaScript and Fetch API):**

```javascript
// Function to reserve a timeslot
async function reserveTimeslot(slotId, userId) {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(`/api/timeslots/${slotId}/reserve`, {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
            body: JSON.stringify({ user_id: userId })
        });
        
        if (response.ok) {
            // Start countdown timer
            startCountdown(slotId);
            // Update UI to reflect reservation
            markSlotAsReserved(slotId);
        } else if (response.status === 409) {
            alert('Sorry, this timeslot is already reserved or booked.');
            refreshAvailableSlots();
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error reserving timeslot:', error);
    }
}

// Function to start countdown
function startCountdown(slotId) {
    const countdownDuration = 3 * 60; // 3 minutes in seconds
    let remainingTime = countdownDuration;

    const timer = setInterval(() => {
        remainingTime--;
        updateCountdownUI(slotId, remainingTime);

        if (remainingTime <= 0) {
            clearInterval(timer);
            releaseReservation(slotId);
        }
    }, 1000);
}

// Function to release reservation after timeout
async function releaseReservation(slotId) {
    // Automatically cancel the reservation if the user hasn't booked
    try {
        await fetch(`/api/timeslots/${slotId}/cancel`, {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
            body: JSON.stringify({ user_id: currentUserId })
        });
        // Update UI to reflect availability
        markSlotAsAvailable(slotId);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error releasing reservation:', error);
    }
}
```

### **2.5. Concurrency Control**

To prevent race conditions where multiple clients attempt to reserve the same timeslot simultaneously, implement **Pessimistic Locking** at the database level using transactions and row-level locks (as shown in the SQL examples above). This ensures that only one reservation can be successfully made for a timeslot at any given time.

---

## **3. Best Practices**

### **3.1. Atomic Operations**

Ensure that reservation and booking operations are atomic to maintain data consistency. Use database transactions to encapsulate these operations, preventing partial updates that could lead to inconsistent states.

### **3.2. Lock Timeouts**

Implement lock timeouts to automatically release reservations after the specified period (3 minutes in your case). This prevents timeslots from being held indefinitely due to user inaction or unexpected failures.

### **3.3. User Feedback**

Provide clear and immediate feedback to users regarding the status of their reservation and booking process. Inform them about the remaining time to complete the booking and notify them if a reservation fails or expires.

### **3.4. Scalability Considerations**

As your application grows, consider the following to maintain performance:

- **Efficient Queries:** Optimize database queries with proper indexing.
- **Load Balancing:** Distribute API requests across multiple server instances.
- **Caching:** Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data, such as available timeslots, while ensuring cache invalidation upon reservation changes.

### **3.5. Security Measures**

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Ensure that only authenticated users can reserve and book timeslots. Verify that reservation and booking actions are authorized for the requesting user.
- **Input Validation:** Validate all incoming data to prevent SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other security vulnerabilities.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the reservation system (e.g., excessive reservation attempts).

   - **ReservationModal:** Allows users to reserve and book a selected timeslot.

3. **Implement State Management:**
   - Use React’s `useState` and `useEffect` hooks or integrate a state management library like **Redux**.

4. **Handle API Interactions:**
   - Use **Axios** to communicate with the backend API for reserving and booking timeslots.

5. **Implement Real-Time Updates:**
   - Optionally integrate **WebSockets** using libraries like **Socket.IO** to receive real-time updates about timeslot availability.

### **5.3. Sample Code Snippets**

**Backend: Express Route for Reserving a Timeslot**

```javascript
// routes/timeslots.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const { Timeslot } = require('../models');
const { Sequelize } = require('sequelize');

// Reserve a timeslot
router.post('/:id/reserve', async (req, res) => {
    const slotId = req.params.id;
    const userId = req.body.user_id;

    try {
        await Timeslot.sequelize.transaction(async (t) => {
            // Lock the row for update
            const timeslot = await Timeslot.findOne({
                where: { id: slotId },
                lock: t.LOCK.UPDATE,
                transaction: t
            });

            if (timeslot.status !== 'available') {
                return res.status(409).json({ message: 'Timeslot is not available.' });
            }

            // Update the timeslot to reserved
            await timeslot.update({
                status: 'reserved',
                reserved_by: userId,
                reserved_at: new Date()
            }, { transaction: t });

            return res.status(200).json({ message: 'Timeslot reserved successfully.', timeslot });
        });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error reserving timeslot:', error);
        return res.status(500).json({ message: 'Internal server error.' });
    }
});

module.exports = router;
```

**Backend: Background Worker to Release Expired Reservations**

```javascript
// workers/releaseReservations.js
const cron = require('node-cron');
const { Timeslot } = require('../models');
const { Op } = require('sequelize');

// Schedule to run every minute
cron.schedule('* * * * *', async () => {
    const expiryTime = new Date(Date.now() - 3 * 60 * 1000); // 3 minutes ago

    try {
        const expiredSlots = await Timeslot.findAll({
            where: {
                status: 'reserved',
                reserved_at: { [Op.lt]: expiryTime }
            }
        });

        for (const slot of expiredSlots) {
            await slot.update({
                status: 'available',
                reserved_by: null,
                reserved_at: null
            });
            console.log(`Released expired reservation for timeslot ID: ${slot.id}`);
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error releasing expired reservations:', error);
    }
});
```

**Frontend: Reserving a Timeslot (React)**

```javascript
// components/TimeslotList.js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

function TimeslotList({ userId }) {
    const [timeslots, setTimeslots] = useState([]);

    useEffect(() => {
        fetchTimeslots();
        // Optionally set up polling or WebSocket for real-time updates
    }, []);

    const fetchTimeslots = async () => {
        try {
            const response = await axios.get('/api/timeslots');
            setTimeslots(response.data);
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error fetching timeslots:', error);
        }
    };

    const reserveSlot = async (slotId) => {
        try {
            const response = await axios.post(`/api/timeslots/${slotId}/reserve`, { user_id: userId });
            if (response.status === 200) {
                // Update UI to reflect reservation and start countdown
                // Implement countdown logic here
                alert('Timeslot reserved! Complete booking within 3 minutes.');
                fetchTimeslots(); // Refresh timeslots to hide the reserved slot
            }
        } catch (error) {
            if (error.response && error.response.status === 409) {
                alert('Sorry, this timeslot is already reserved or booked.');
            } else {
                console.error('Error reserving timeslot:', error);
            }
        }
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <h2>Available Timeslots</h2>
            <ul>
                {timeslots.map(slot => (
                    <li key={slot.id}>
                        {slot.start_time} - {slot.end_time}
                        {slot.status === 'available' && (
                            <button onClick={() => reserveSlot(slot.id)}>Reserve</button>
                        )}
                        {slot.status !== 'available' && (
                            <span> - {slot.status}</span>
                        )}
                    </li>
                ))}
            </ul>
        </div>
    );
}

export default TimeslotList;
```

## **6. Additional Considerations**

### **6.1. Handling Edge Cases**

1. **User Closes Browser or Navigates Away:**
   - Implement mechanisms to detect when a user abandons the booking process and release the reservation. This is partially handled by the 3-minute timeout, but additional client-side events (e.g., `onbeforeunload`) can attempt to notify the server to cancel the reservation immediately.

2. **Network Failures:**
   - Ensure that the system gracefully handles network interruptions during the reservation or booking process. Implement retry mechanisms or inform the user to retry the operation.

3. **High Traffic Scenarios:**
   - Optimize database performance and consider load balancing if expecting high traffic, ensuring that reservation operations remain performant.

### **6.2. User Experience Enhancements**

1. **Visual Indicators:**
   - Clearly differentiate between available, reserved, and booked timeslots using colors or icons.
   - Show a countdown timer during the reservation period.

2. **Notifications:**
   - Inform users when a reservation is about to expire or has expired.
   - Send email or SMS confirmations upon successful booking.

3. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure the booking interface is mobile-friendly, as many users may book via smartphones.

### **6.3. Testing and Validation**

1. **Unit Testing:**
   - Write tests for each API endpoint to ensure correct behavior under various scenarios.

2. **Concurrency Testing:**
   - Simulate multiple clients attempting to reserve the same timeslot simultaneously to verify that only one reservation is successful.

3. **Load Testing:**
   - Assess how the system performs under high load and optimize as necessary.

4. **Security Testing:**
   - Conduct security audits to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

---

## **7. Summary**

Implementing a **timeslot booking system** with the specified requirements involves:

1. **Database Design:** Structuring your database to manage timeslot states effectively.
2. **API Development:** Creating endpoints to handle reserving, booking, and cancelling timeslots with proper concurrency control.
3. **Reservation Timeout:** Implementing a mechanism to automatically release reservations after 3 minutes if not confirmed.
4. **Frontend Integration:** Ensuring the UI reflects real-time availability and guides users through the booking process.
5. **Concurrency Management:** Using pessimistic locking and atomic database operations to prevent double-booking.
6. **Best Practices:** Following best practices in atomicity, user feedback, scalability, security, and thorough testing.
