### Part 1


### Part 2

1. **Attribute Precedence**: Understanding how Thymeleaf prioritizes attributes, so you can handle scenarios where multiple directives may apply to the same element.

2. **Utility Objects**: Learn to use built-in utility objects like `#strings`, `#dates`, `#numbers`, and `#objects` for more complex data manipulation directly in templates.

3. **Inline Text Processing**: Thymeleaf supports inline expressions, which allow for text manipulation directly within text nodes.

4. **Advanced Fragment Composition**: Go beyond basic fragments to manage complex layouts by composing multiple fragments dynamically.

5. **Conditional Expressions and Switch Statements**: This covers conditional logic with `th:switch` and `th:case` for better control over display logic in more complex pages.

6. **DOM Manipulation with `th:attr`**: Dynamically set multiple attributes on elements, allowing for flexible control over HTML attributes.

7. **Thymeleaf Security Integration**: Thymeleaf integrates with Spring Security, making it useful to learn how to handle authorization, display content based on roles, and manage security contexts.
