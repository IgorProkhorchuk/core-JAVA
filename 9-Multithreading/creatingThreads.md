To create threads in Java, there are two primary approaches:

1. **Implementing the Runnable Interface**
2. **Extending the Thread Class**

Here’s a detailed breakdown of each, including code examples, the advantages of each approach, and common usage scenarios.

### 1. Implementing the Runnable Interface

Implementing `Runnable` is a widely-used way to create threads in Java. This approach allows a class to be "run" as a thread, but it also permits the class to extend another superclass if needed, because Java does not support multiple inheritance. This flexibility is a major advantage.

#### Steps to Create a Thread with Runnable:
1. **Implement the Runnable Interface**: Implement the `Runnable` interface in a class.
2. **Override the run() Method**: Define the `run()` method, which contains the code to execute in the thread.
3. **Create a Thread Instance**: Create a `Thread` object and pass the instance of the class implementing `Runnable` to the `Thread` constructor.
4. **Start the Thread**: Call `start()` on the `Thread` object to begin the execution of the thread.

#### Example Code:
Here’s how to create and start a thread using `Runnable`.

```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        // Code that executes when the thread is started
        System.out.println("Thread is running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class RunnableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an instance of the Runnable implementation
        MyRunnable myRunnable = new MyRunnable();
        
        // Pass it to a new Thread instance
        Thread thread = new Thread(myRunnable);
        
        // Start the thread
        thread.start();
        
        System.out.println("Main thread running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}
```

#### Explanation of Key Components:
- **`MyRunnable`**: Implements `Runnable` and overrides `run()`, where the thread’s code is written.
- **`new Thread(myRunnable)`**: Associates the `Runnable` object (`myRunnable`) with a `Thread` object.
- **`thread.start()`**: Initiates the thread, which then calls the `run()` method of the `Runnable`.

#### Benefits of Using Runnable:
- **Better OOP Practice**: `Runnable` keeps the `Thread` behavior separate from the class that executes tasks, promoting separation of concerns.
- **Allows Multiple Inheritance**: Since Java does not support multiple inheritance, implementing `Runnable` instead of extending `Thread` allows the class to extend another class if needed.
- **Code Reusability**: Runnable objects can be reused across different threads.

#### Common Use Cases:
- When the task does not require modifying thread behavior directly, such as setting custom priorities.
- When the task needs to be run in different contexts or reused.
- When you want the flexibility to inherit from another class.

### 2. Extending the Thread Class

Alternatively, you can create a thread by extending the `Thread` class. This approach is more straightforward, but it limits flexibility because it prevents the class from extending any other class.

#### Steps to Create a Thread by Extending Thread:
1. **Extend the Thread Class**: Create a class that extends `Thread`.
2. **Override the run() Method**: Define the `run()` method, which will contain the thread’s code.
3. **Create an Instance of the Subclass**: Instantiate the subclass of `Thread`.
4. **Start the Thread**: Call `start()` to execute the thread.

#### Example Code:
Here’s how to create and start a thread by extending `Thread`.

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class ThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Instantiate the Thread subclass
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        
        // Start the thread
        thread.start();
        
        System.out.println("Main thread running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}
```

#### Explanation of Key Components:
- **`MyThread`**: Subclasses `Thread` and overrides `run()`.
- **`thread.start()`**: Starts the thread and causes the `run()` method of `MyThread` to be executed.

#### Benefits of Extending Thread:
- **Easy to Write**: Code is slightly simpler since no `Runnable` instance is needed.
- **Full Access to Thread Class Methods**: Directly using `Thread` gives access to thread control methods (e.g., `setName()`, `getPriority()`, etc.), which can be useful in more complex applications.

#### Common Use Cases:
- When a thread requires custom behavior that isn’t provided by `Runnable`, such as setting thread priorities or manipulating the thread state.
- When the class does not need to inherit from another class, allowing it to extend `Thread`.

### Comparing Runnable and Thread

| Aspect                           | Runnable                                    | Thread                                        |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Inheritance**                  | Allows the class to extend another class.   | Prevents extending any other class.           |
| **Code Reusability**             | Runnable can be reused in multiple threads. | Requires a new `Thread` object each time.     |
| **Separation of Concerns**       | Separates task logic from thread mechanics. | Combines both task and thread management.     |
| **Ease of Implementation**       | Slightly more complex to set up.            | Easier to implement with fewer lines of code. |
| **Thread Customization**         | Limited control over thread properties.     | Full control over thread properties.          |

### Additional Details on Thread Control

- **`start()`**: Used to start a thread; it automatically invokes the `run()` method.
- **`run()`**: Contains the code that the thread executes.
- **`sleep(long millis)`**: Makes the current thread sleep (pause) for a specified number of milliseconds.
- **`join()`**: Pauses the execution of the current thread until the specified thread finishes execution.
- **`setName()` and `getName()`**: Used to assign and retrieve the name of a thread.
- **`setPriority(int priority)`**: Sets the priority of the thread. Priorities range from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest), with the default value being 5.
- **`isAlive()`**: Returns `true` if the thread is still running; otherwise, `false`.

### Example of Controlling Threads with Runnable

```java
class ControlledRunnable implements Runnable {
    private String name;

    public ControlledRunnable(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(name + " - Count: " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(500); // Sleep for 500 milliseconds
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println(name + " interrupted.");
            }
        }
        System.out.println(name + " completed.");
    }
}

public class ThreadControlExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new ControlledRunnable("Thread 1"));
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(new ControlledRunnable("Thread 2"));

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();

        try {
            thread1.join(); // Wait for thread1 to complete
            thread2.join(); // Wait for thread2 to complete
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("All threads completed.");
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `ControlledRunnable` prints a count, simulating work. Each count introduces a delay with `sleep(500)`.
- `join()` ensures the main thread waits for both `thread1` and `thread2` to finish before proceeding.

### Summary

Both `Runnable` and `Thread` provide powerful ways to create and control threads in Java. For better flexibility and adherence to good design principles, `Runnable` is generally preferred.
