 A list of commonly used **Spring Boot** annotations:

### Core Annotations
1. **@SpringBootApplication**  
   Marks the main class of a Spring Boot application. It’s a combination of three annotations:
   - `@Configuration`: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions.
   - `@EnableAutoConfiguration`: Enables Spring Boot's auto-configuration mechanism.
   - `@ComponentScan`: Enables component scanning to detect Spring-managed components.

2. **@Component**  
   Marks a Java class as a Spring component. It's a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component, usually detected by `@ComponentScan`.

3. **@Controller**  
   Specialized version of `@Component` used to define web controllers in MVC applications. Used to handle HTTP requests and return a response.

4. **@Service**  
   Also a specialization of `@Component`, this annotation is used to denote a service class that holds business logic.

5. **@Repository**  
   Used to define data access objects (DAOs). Spring translates database-related exceptions into Spring’s data access exceptions when this annotation is used.

### Dependency Injection Annotations
6. **@Autowired**  
   Used to automatically inject dependencies (beans) into a class. Spring will resolve and inject the relevant bean.

7. **@Qualifier**  
   Used in conjunction with `@Autowired` to specify which bean should be injected when there are multiple beans of the same type.

8. **@Primary**  
   Indicates that a bean should be given preference when multiple beans of the same type exist.

### Configuration and Bean Definitions
9. **@Configuration**  
   Indicates that the class contains `@Bean` definitions and can be used by Spring IoC container as a source of bean definitions.

10. **@Bean**  
    Used to define a bean explicitly within a `@Configuration` class. The method annotated with `@Bean` will return the bean that will be managed by Spring.

11. **@Value**  
    Injects values from properties files or environment variables into a Spring bean.

12. **@Profile**  
    Used to specify the environments (profiles) in which a bean should be instantiated. Useful for differentiating between development, production, etc.

### Web and REST Annotations
13. **@RestController**  
    Combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`, meaning that the methods in this controller will return JSON/XML data directly to the response body.

14. **@RequestMapping**  
    Maps HTTP requests to handler methods of MVC and REST controllers. It can be used on both classes and methods to define the URL path and HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).

15. **@GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping, @PatchMapping**  
    Specialized annotations for `@RequestMapping` for common HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH). These are more readable and less verbose.

16. **@PathVariable**  
    Binds URI template variables in the request URL to method parameters in the controller.

17. **@RequestParam**  
    Extracts query parameters from the URL and binds them to method parameters.

18. **@RequestBody**  
    Binds the body of a web request to a method parameter, usually used in REST controllers for POST and PUT requests.

19. **@ResponseBody**  
    Indicates that the return value of a method should be written directly to the response body, bypassing any view resolvers.

### Validation Annotations
20. **@Valid**  
    Used to trigger validation on method parameters or fields. Typically used with `@RequestBody` or form objects.

21. **@NotNull, @Size, @Min, @Max, @Pattern**  
    Standard JSR-303/JSR-380 bean validation annotations that validate fields in DTOs or form objects.

### Transaction Management
22. **@Transactional**  
    Used to demarcate transactional boundaries. Any method or class annotated with `@Transactional` will be wrapped in a transaction, and if an exception occurs, the transaction will roll back.

### Caching Annotations
23. **@Cacheable**  
    Marks a method as cacheable. When called, the result will be cached based on the method parameters, and subsequent calls with the same parameters will return the cached result.

24. **@CacheEvict**  
    Used to clear cache entries.

25. **@CachePut**  
    Updates or inserts cache entries without skipping the method execution, ensuring the cache is updated after every call.

### Asynchronous and Scheduling Annotations
26. **@Async**  
    Enables the execution of methods asynchronously. Methods annotated with `@Async` will run in a separate thread.

27. **@Scheduled**  
    Used to define scheduled tasks. It allows methods to run periodically based on a cron expression or a fixed delay.

### Security Annotations
28. **@PreAuthorize, @PostAuthorize**  
    Used to apply method-level security based on roles and permissions. `@PreAuthorize` checks before method execution, while `@PostAuthorize` checks after method execution.

29. **@Secured**  
    Specifies security roles required to access a method.

30. **@RolesAllowed**  
    Similar to `@Secured`, used for specifying roles at the method level.

### Testing Annotations
31. **@SpringBootTest**  
    Used to configure and bootstrap a complete Spring application context for integration tests.

32. **@MockBean**  
    Used in testing to mock a Spring-managed bean, allowing you to replace a real bean with a mock for testing purposes.

33. **@TestConfiguration**  
    A specialized version of `@Configuration` used for tests, allowing for test-specific bean configurations.
