## Javadoc: A Tool for Generating API Documentation

**Javadoc** is a tool that automatically generates API documentation from Java source code. It extracts comments and other information from the code to create well-formatted HTML documentation.

### Basic Structure of Javadoc Comments
Javadoc comments start with `/**` and end with `*/`. They can be placed before classes, interfaces, methods, and fields.

**Example:**
```java
/**
 * This is a class representing a person.
 */
public class Person {
    /**
     * The name of the person.
     */
    private String name;

    /**
     * Constructs a new Person object with the specified name.
     *
     * @param name the name of the person
     */
    public Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    /**
     * Gets the name of the person.
     *
     * @return the name of the person
     */
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}
```

### Javadoc Tags
Javadoc supports various tags to provide additional information about classes, methods, fields, and parameters. Some commonly used tags include:
* **@author:** Specifies the author of the class or method.
* **@version:** Specifies the version number of the class or method.
* **@param:** Describes a parameter of a method.
* **@return:** Describes the return value of a method.
* **@throws:** Describes an exception that a method might throw.
* **@deprecated:** Marks a class, method, or field as deprecated.

### Generating Javadoc
To generate Javadoc documentation, you can use the `javadoc` command-line tool. For example, to generate documentation for all Java files in the current directory:

```bash
javadoc *.java
```

This will create an `index.html` file in the current directory, which serves as the entry point for the generated documentation.

### Best Practices
* **Use clear and concise comments.**
* **Include relevant information.**
* **Use appropriate tags.**
* **Keep documentation up-to-date.**
* **Format comments consistently.**

By following these guidelines, you can create high-quality Javadoc documentation that is easy to understand and use.
