* **byte:** Represents a single byte of data (8 bits).
* **short:** Represents a 16-bit signed integer.
* **int:** Represents a 32-bit signed integer.
* **long:** Represents a 64-bit signed integer.
* **float:** Represents a 32-bit floating-point number.

* **String:** Represents a sequence of characters.

### Flow Control
* **if:** Conditional statement.
* **else:** Alternative block in an if statement.
* **switch:** Multiple-choice conditional statement.
* **case:** Represents a possible value in a switch statement.
