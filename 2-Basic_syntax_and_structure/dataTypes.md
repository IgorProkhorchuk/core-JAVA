### Primitive and Non-Primitive Data Types  


In Java, data types are broadly classified into two categories:
1. **Primitive Data Types**
2. **Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types**

Both of these types define the kinds of values that can be stored and manipulated within Java programs. Let’s explore each category in detail.

## 1. Primitive Data Types in Java

**Primitive data types** are the most basic data types available in Java. They are predefined by the language and serve as the building blocks for data manipulation. Primitive types directly store the values and are not objects. Java provides 8 primitive data types, grouped into four main categories:

### 1.1 Integer Types
Used for storing whole numbers (both positive and negative).

- **byte**: 
  - Size: 8 bits (1 byte)
  - Range: -128 to 127
  - Example: `byte b = 100;`
  - Use Case: Best when you need to save memory in large arrays where memory savings are critical.

- **short**:
  - Size: 16 bits (2 bytes)
  - Range: -32,768 to 32,767
  - Example: `short s = 10000;`
  - Use Case: Used in situations where a wider range than `byte` is needed, but memory is still a concern.

- **int**:
  - Size: 32 bits (4 bytes)
  - Range: -2^31 to 2^31 - 1 (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
  - Example: `int i = 100000;`
  - Use Case: Default type for integer values, often used in loops, counters, etc.

- **long**:
  - Size: 64 bits (8 bytes)
  - Range: -2^63 to 2^63 - 1
  - Example: `long l = 100000L;`
  - Use Case: Used when a wider range of values than `int` is needed. You must append an "L" or "l" to indicate a `long` value.

### 1.2 Floating-Point Types
Used for storing fractional numbers (numbers with decimal points).

- **float**:
  - Size: 32 bits (4 bytes)
  - Range: Approximately ±3.40282347E+38F (6-7 decimal digits)
  - Example: `float f = 10.5f;`
  - Use Case: For saving memory in large arrays of floating-point numbers. You must append an "F" or "f" to indicate a `float` value.

- **double**:
  - Size: 64 bits (8 bytes)
  - Range: Approximately ±1.79769313486231570E+308 (15 decimal digits)
  - Example: `double d = 20.99;`
  - Use Case: The default type for floating-point numbers. It offers better precision compared to `float`.

### 1.3 Character Type
Used for storing single characters.

- **char**:
  - Size: 16 bits (2 bytes)
  - Range: 0 to 65,535 (Unicode character set)
  - Example: `char ch = 'A';`
  - Use Case: Used to represent individual characters, such as letters, digits, or symbols. Java uses Unicode to support multiple languages.

### 1.4 Boolean Type
Used for storing logical values (true or false).

- **boolean**:
  - Size: 1 bit (depends on JVM, technically not precisely defined)
  - Values: `true` or `false`
  - Example: `boolean isJavaFun = true;`
  - Use Case: Used for simple flags that track true/false conditions. Commonly used in conditional logic like `if` statements.

### Summary of Primitive Data Types:

| Data Type | Size     | Default Value | Range (Approximate)                          | Wrapper Class |
|-----------|----------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `byte`    | 1 byte   | 0             | -128 to 127                                 | `Byte`        |
| `short`   | 2 bytes  | 0             | -32,768 to 32,767                           | `Short`       |
| `int`     | 4 bytes  | 0             | -2^31 to 2^31-1                             | `Integer`     |
| `long`    | 8 bytes  | 0L            | -2^63 to 2^63-1                             | `Long`        |
| `float`   | 4 bytes  | 0.0f          | ±1.4E-45 to ±3.4028235E38 (7 decimal digits)| `Float`       |
| `double`  | 8 bytes  | 0.0d          | ±4.9E-324 to ±1.7976931348623157E308        | `Double`      |
| `char`    | 2 bytes  | '\u0000' (null)| 0 to 65,535 (Unicode)                       | `Character`   |
| `boolean` | 1 bit    | false         | true/false                                  | `Boolean`     |

## 2. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types in Java

**Non-primitive data types**, also known as **reference types**, are not predefined by the language (unlike primitive types). Instead, they are created by the programmer. Non-primitive data types **reference** objects or arrays, and the variable stores a reference to a memory location rather than the actual data.

Common non-primitive data types include:
- **Classes**
- **Arrays**
- **Interfaces**
- **Strings**

### 2.1 Classes

A **class** is a blueprint for objects. It defines properties (fields) and behaviors (methods). When an object is created, memory is allocated to store data, and the reference is stored in the variable.

#### Example:
```java
class Person {
    String name;
    int age;

    // Constructor
    Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    void display() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person p = new Person("John", 25);
        p.display();  // Output: Name: John, Age: 25
    }
}
```

- Here, `Person` is a class, and `p` is an object (or instance) of that class. The variable `p` does not hold the actual object but a **reference** to the memory location where the object is stored.

### 2.2 Arrays

An **array** is a data structure that stores multiple values of the same type. Arrays in Java are reference types.

#### Example:
```java
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (int i : numbers) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

- In this example, `numbers` is a reference to an array of integers. The reference points to the memory location where the array elements are stored.

### 2.3 Interfaces

An **interface** is a blueprint for a class that only defines abstract methods and constant fields (no implementation). It is used for achieving **abstraction** and **multiple inheritance** in Java.

#### Example:
```java
interface Vehicle {
    void start();
}

class Car implements Vehicle {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car is starting.");
    }
}
```

- Here, `Vehicle` is an interface, and `Car` is a class that implements the `Vehicle` interface.

### 2.4 Strings

**String** is a special class in Java used to represent sequences of characters. Although `String` is a reference type, it has special treatment in Java, as string literals are stored in a common pool.

#### Example:
```java
String message = "Hello, Java!";
System.out.println(message);
```

- `message` is a reference to the `String` object. Strings are immutable, meaning that once created, they cannot be changed.

### Key Features of Non-Primitive Types:
- **Reference to memory locations**: Non-primitive types store a reference (address) to the memory location where the actual object/data is stored.
- **More complex**: They can contain multiple fields and methods.
- **Null by default**: Non-primitive types can be `null`, which means they do not reference any object or data in memory.
- **Can be user-defined**: Non-primitive types like classes, arrays, and interfaces are created by the programmer.
- **Size varies**: The size of reference types is determined by the implementation of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

### Differences Between Primitive and Non-Primitive Data Types

| Feature                        | Primitive Data Types                                     | Non-Primitive Data Types                         |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**                  | Basic types predefined by Java.                         | Complex types defined by the programmer.         |
| **Data Storage**                | Stores the actual value.                                | Stores a reference (memory address).             |
| **Size**                        | Fixed size (e.g., `int` is 4 bytes).                    | Size depends on the object or data structure.    |
| **Default Value**               | Defined defaults (e.g., 0 for `int`, `false` for `boolean`).| Null by default.                                |
| **Example**                     | `int

`, `char`, `float`                                  | `String`, `Array`, `Object`, `Class`             |
| **Nullability**                 | Cannot be `null`.                                       | Can be `null`.                                   |
| **Methods**                     | No built-in methods.                                    | Can have methods (e.g., `String.length()`).      |
| **Memory Allocation**           | Memory is allocated directly to store the value.        | Memory is allocated dynamically for objects.     |
| **Wrapper Classes**             | Wrapper classes available (e.g., `Integer`, `Boolean`). | All non-primitive types are classes or objects.  |

### Conclusion

In Java, understanding the difference between primitive and non-primitive data types is crucial for memory management, performance optimization, and code design. Primitive types provide simplicity and speed, whereas non-primitive types offer flexibility, reusability, and complex behavior. Together, they form the foundation of Java's strongly-typed system.
